	The biggest advantage to using floating point over fixed point is that floating point representation is able to hold a much wider range of values than fixed point representation. This larger range of values is neccessary when doing very small or very large calculations. Some dissadvantages of floating point is that floating point is more complex to handle and therefore can decrease performance of the calculation. Because of this if the calculation being performed are between the fixed point range it is better to use fixed point, but if the numbers excede the range then floating point is a neccessity.
